# Python_mini_applications

I am including some of the mini projects that I have worked on Python Object-oriented. 

## 1. Student Course Registration
Write a Python Program to manage Student Course Registration. Each Student has a
name and student number and can register for a list of courses belonging to a Department. Each Department has a department name and a department code and has a list of courses which the student can register from. Each Course has a course description, course code, credit and the department to which it belongs.

## 2. Registration Form using the Tkinter
The app uses button Submit writes all the details entered in a text file. All fields are mandatory, if the user does not choose a country, gender or select a programming language when the Submit button is clicked, then popup a message box asking the user to complete the missing information before saving it to the file.

## 3. Pizza Order app using the Tkinter
The user must use a radio button, check boxes and Process Selection button to make selections and process the order. All fields are mandatory, if the user does not choose Topping, Pizza size or Pizza Type then popup a message box asking the user to complete the missing information. Use a text area to display the customerâ€™s order and the amount due.
